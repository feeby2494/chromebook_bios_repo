This is a collection of bios files for chromebooks that are not 
tied to a MDN and are open to use Developer Mode for. Often when replacing 
chromebook motherboards, we find one that works, but it still locked to a 
school or organizaion even when these were sold to us. 

In order to perserve chromebook boards, I have made these bios files of open .bin files avaiable, so that other Chromebook techs can find it usefull. I would also like to find schematics and boardviews for these, but they are hard to come by.

If you have some open bios files for different chromebook boards, then do a pull request! Like the Macbook Board repair community, I want to make the CB board repair community prosper.

Thank you,
